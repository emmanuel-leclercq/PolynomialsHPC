# PolynomialsHPC

This is an attempt to build a headers-only high performance polynomial functions libraries, single parameter for now.

### Polynomial (dense) class

This class represents polynomial coefficients as a vector, degrees are implied.
We make heavy use of the <algorithm> and <numeric> libraries for efficiency.
The adjust() method removes trailing zeros, basic accessors are provided.
the is_sorted parameter is left to user to set for efficiency.
Addition between non-ordered sparse polynomials results in a sorted sparse polynomial (no sorting overhead).

#### Operations availableÂ :

1. addition: O(min(n,m)) implementation, we take the largest (in terms of degree) of lhs and rhs, then add the terms
2. Subtraction: similar method to addition, but not using addition for speed
3. Multiplication: implementation in O(n*m) for now, will try FFT for O(nlog(n))
4. Division: euclid algorithm
5. Evaluation: Horner's method
6. Factorization (TODO)
7. Interpolation: takes a vector<std::pair<T x,T y>> as input and returns a dense polynomial<T>
8. nth derivatives: includes antiderivative (n<0), both derivative and antiderivative are O(n), we use a swap trick for
   the latter. Two implementations -> P.derivative() and derivative(P) for convenience (the latter doesnt modify P)
9. Root finder (TODO)
10. Plotting (TODO)

### Sparse Polynomial class

A polynomial is considered sparse when more than half its coefficients are zeros.
Unlike the dense polynomial class, we store coefficients in a linked list (x^999+1 is stored in a 2-elements lists
instead of a 1000 elements vector).
Assuming t is the number of elements in the list representing a sparse polynomial, our goal is to approach O(t)
complexity for most operations, which is not always possible. We detail below the implementations (TODO)
