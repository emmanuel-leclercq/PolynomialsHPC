# PolynomialsHPC

# This is an attempt to build a headers-only high performance polynomial functions libraries, single parameter for now.

# Features included/in development:
1. Polynomial factorization
2. Polynomial multiplication, division, addition
3. Lagrange interpolation
4. nth derivatives
5. Root finder
6. Plotting
7. Sparse polynomials (x^10000 +1 stored in a length 2 list instead of 10001 length vector)
8. Piece-wise polynomials
