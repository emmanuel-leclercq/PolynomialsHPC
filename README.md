# PolynomialsHPC

# This is an attempt to build a headers-only high performance polynomial functions libraries, single parameter for now.

# Polynomial (dense) class features:
1. multiplication, division, addition 
2. evaluation
3. factorization 
4. interpolation 
5. nth derivatives
6. Root finder
7. Plotting

#Sparse Polynomial class
1. Same operations as the dense class
